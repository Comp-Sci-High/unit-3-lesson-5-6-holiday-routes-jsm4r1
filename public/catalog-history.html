      <h1 class="center">History of Valentine's Day — Catalog</h1>
      <p class="center">A brief overview of the holiday's origins and evolution.</p>

      <section class="content">
        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day blends several historical threads. Ancient Roman festivals such as <em>Lupercalia</em> (mid-February) celebrated fertility and included rites that were later reinterpreted by Christian communities. By the late Roman and early medieval periods, one or more Christian martyrs called "Valentine" became associated with the date, and religious observance gradually mixed with local customs for pairing and courtship.</p>

        <h2>Medieval Customs</h2>
        <p>In medieval England and France, mid-February was believed to be the start of birds' mating season, which fostered an association between the date and romantic pairing. Poets and courtly love traditions helped popularize the idea of expressing affection through verse and small tokens among the nobility and later the broader public.</p>

        <h2>Valentine's Cards & Poetry</h2>
        <p>By the 15th century, written notes and poems exchanged among lovers were documented in Britain. Handmade paper valentines became more common in the 17th and 18th centuries. The rise of letter-writing culture and printed broadsides in the 18th century set the stage for commercially produced valentines in the 19th century.</p>

        <h2>Victorian Era & Industrialization</h2>
        <p>The Victorian era saw a huge expansion in the popularity of sending sentimental cards. Advances in printing (lithography) and postal services made it affordable to send decorative cards to friends and loved ones. Lace, ribbons, and elaborate typography became common decorative motifs, and the practice spread with the British Empire and American social customs.</p>

        <h2>Commercialization and Modern Traditions</h2>
        <p>In the 20th century, Valentine's Day became increasingly commercialized: greeting cards, boxed chocolates, flowers, and mass-market gifts became central to how many people celebrated. Today, the holiday includes romantic partners, friends, and family in many countries. Cultural practices vary widely—from romantic dinners and proposals to schoolroom exchanges of simple valentines and candies.</p>

        <h2>Global Spread and Local Variations</h2>
        <p>While originating in Europe, Valentine's customs have been adopted and adapted worldwide. Some countries emphasize romantic love, others focus on friendship, and many blend local traditions with imported commercial elements. For example, in parts of East Asia, the exchange of chocolates and later reciprocation days have evolved into unique regional customs.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts & Sources</h2>
        <p>Fun facts: the tradition of heart-shaped symbols and red roses as emblems of love became popular through art and literature; the first mass-produced valentines appeared in the early 1800s. For more reading, reputable sources include encyclopedias and cultural histories (e.g., Britannica and history-focused articles), as well as public-domain poetry collections that show how love language evolved over centuries.</p>
